# Landing page for our course
We are creating a landing page inspired from [BC Full Stack programm](https://en.bc.fi/qualifications/full-stack-web-developer-program/)

# 1. Project Setup  
- Create a new project folder and add the following files:  
  - `index.html`  
  - `styles.css`  

#  2. Hero Section (Full-Screen Background with Slogan)  
- Add a hero section with a full-width background image.  
- Inside the hero section, include:  
  - A large heading (e.g., "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer").  
  - A subheading (e.g., "Learn modern web development and start your career in tech").  
  - A call-to-action button (e.g., "Apply Now").  

- CSS Requirements:  
  - Set the background image to cover the entire section (`background-size: cover;`).  
  - Use Google Fonts that match the example page (e.g., "Poppins").  

#  3. About the Course Section  
- Create an "About the Course" section with:  
  - A short paragraph describing the course.  
  - A list of key topics covered (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP).  

- CSS Requirements:  
  - Style the section with a background color matching the school's branding.  
  - Use different font weights for headers and text.  
  - Style the list with icons or pseudo-elements (`::before`).  


#  4. Use School Colors and Logo  
- Find and use the Business College Helsinki logo.  
- Apply the official colors (check the website's styles).  
- Make sure the typography and spacing match the reference page.  


#  5. Button and Hover Effects  
- Add a hover effect on the button (e.g., background color change).  
- Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to create smooth transitions.
